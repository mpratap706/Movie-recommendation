# Movie Recommender System

This project implements a movie recommender system using machine learning techniques and web technologies. The system allows users to select a movie from a dropdown menu and receive personalized recommendations based on the selected movie's similarity to others in the dataset. The recommendations are displayed along with movie posters fetched from The Movie Database (TMDb) API.

## Features

- User-friendly interface built with Streamlit.
- Machine learning model for recommending similar movies.
- Integration with TMDb API for fetching movie posters.
- Interactive display of recommended movies and their posters.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Streamlit
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Requests
